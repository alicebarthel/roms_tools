Python and Matlab scripts for pre- and post-processing of ROMS simulations. Read the comments at the beginning of each file to find out what they do.

Created for the circumpolar Antarctic configuration of ROMS-CICE-MCT with a quarter-degree grid; should be easy to adapt to other domains.

NB: Use the 2008 version of Matlab on katabatic. These scripts depend on existing ROMS Matlab tools which are stored on katabatic and don't work with the newer versions of Matlab.

Not NB but good to know: ipython is a much nicer python interpreter than plain python, if it's available on your system.
