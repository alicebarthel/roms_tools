Python scripts for pre- and post-processing of ROMS simulations, and some interactive plotting routines. See file_guide.txt for descriptions of what they do and how to use them.

Created for the circumpolar Antarctic configuration of ROMS-CICE-MCT with a quarter-degree grid; should be easy to adapt to other domains.

Note: ipython is a much nicer python interpreter than plain python, if it's available on your system.
