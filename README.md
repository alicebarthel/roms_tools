Python and Matlab scripts for pre- and post-processing of ROMS simulations.

Created for the circumpolar Antarctic configuration of ROMSIceShelf/ROMSSeaIce with a quarter-degree grid; should be easy to adapt to other domains.

To run Python script file.py: open ipython, then type "run file". You will be prompted to type in file paths and parameters at the command line.
To run Matlab script function.m: open Matlab, then type "function()". File paths and parameters will need to be hard-coded into the file.
